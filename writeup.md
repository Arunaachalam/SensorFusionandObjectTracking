# Sensor Fusion and Object Tracking

In a set of four parts the object tracking and sensor fusion was achieved.

The camera-lidar fusion is an important aspect of an autonomous vehicle in sensing the environment around it. Different systems are also required to fill the gaps in the camera-lidar fusion, like adding Radars and pheripheral cameras.

The biggest challenge is the computation cost associated with this operation. New improved algorithms has to be introduced. And the code will not perform well in dark/foggy images as more improvement is needed in this aspect.
